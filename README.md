nub
===

nub is a visual programming environment driven in your webbrowser, powered by php 5.4 and some javascript.

At present only a sample browser, and some very basic tests are included.

Testing:
--------

To run the browser, you'll need pywebkitgtk (in ubuntu speak that's python-ubuntu), and fire up the php build in webserver.
The webserver must be started in the projects ui folder and the python-webkit script must point to started server on localhost.

Other than that the scripts from the samples folder may be run by php cli.

Current Development
-------------------

Some basic UI controls such as panning, zooming and a little preview window, inserting nodes and connecting them.

Future Development
------------------

At a later state, it's very likely that nodejs will be included so that development may either use that python browser or any other nice modern browser supporting websockets.
